## Stuff to make Java programming easier

This project will include some wrappers and facades for the Java Swing API with
a focus on making casual game development easier for amateur programmers.

Future episodes of the Build Something Awesome livecast will demonstrate how
to use this library.  Episodes are archived at
http://buildsomethingawesome.org/archive.html

To include Awesome Lib in your project, make a Maven project and include this 
dependency:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.buildsomethingawesome.lib</groupId>
      <artifactId>awesome-java-swing</artifactId>
